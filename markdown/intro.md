# Viaduct
Taking Professional Education into the 21st Century


What's the
# biggest
challenge in
## technology
today?
Note: What, would you say, is the universal biggest challenge that
enterprises face when it comes to technology?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/cost.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Is it the necessity to keep cost down and margins high?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/scalable.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Or the ability toto scale: to quickly adapt to massive growth in
demand, or in customer base, for your products and services?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/speed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Or the ability to ramp up, innovate, and go to market quickly?


## Cost
## Scale
## Speed
## Nope <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: In fact, it's none of these.


Expected
## benefits
of modern data center technology
<div id="chart-benefits"></div>
Note: Because while reduced cost, improved scalability and quick
time-to-market are key to the expected **benefits** of modern
technology, like cloud, like distributed storage, like software
defined networking...


# #1
## challenge
in technology adoption:
Note: ... the universal #1 **challenge** that enterprises are facing ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/smart_skilled_worker.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
## Wanted <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: ... is one of skill. More precisely, hiring and training people
so that they are, and remain, able to know, understand and maintain
increasingly complex systems. So, why don't we train them?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/class-377117_1920.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->
Note: because this is what training in the technology industry looks
like. Face to face, single instructor. Small group. This is the best
and most effective way of transferring technology knowledge
today.

## Cost
## Scale
## Speed
## Nope <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: Is this a cost-effective model, that scales to any team size?
Does it allow teams to accumulate knowledge quickly, and does it
enable companies to innovate fast? It does neither.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/distributed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Increasingly distributed and complex systems have no match in
training.  While technology is getting increasingly complex and
distributed, training still happens in unrealistic, overly simplified
lab environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_training.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: It's almost like putting astronauts in a lecture hall with a few
tabletop exercises, ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_strapped.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: and then strapping them into a rocket and flying
them to space without ever setting foot in a realistic simulator.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/broken_model.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: This model is broken and we're here to fix it.


# Viaduct
Bridging Canyons in Professional Education
Note: Viaduct is here to bridge the canyon between technology on the
one hand, and the skills required to run, operate and scale it on the
other, to enable enterprises to scale better and innovate faster.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/system.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: A platform to bring
- cheap
- scalable
- rapid
learning capability to any organization.

# Viaduct
combines


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="//open.edx.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/logo-edx-openedx.png" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: the Open edX learning management platform, one which is sweeping
universities and academic institutions for its superior management
capabilities and flexibility, and it needs to come to professional
education.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openstack-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: OpenStack, a cloud management and orchestration platform
reshaping the way organizations manage and run their data centers.


Full
## Integration
With Real-Life Environments
Note: As a result, Viaduct provides a learning experience that is
directly and smoothly integrated with life-sized, complex
environments. This frees organizations from having to either maintain
a costly parallel training infrastructure, or to settle for
unrealistic scaled-down versions of complex environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/docker-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Imagine being able to give *each and every person* on your
virtualization team a massively scaleable container infrastructure,
using potentially hundreds of Docker containers.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/ceph-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every new hire on your storage team a whole distributed Ceph cluster to
play with in training.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Hadoop_logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every one of your Big Data developers a full Hadoop cluster.

And then combine this with...

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/multidevice.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... a streamlined multi-device
learning platform, so anyone can learn from anywhere, using
desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/multilingual.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... and full multilanguage capability, to level the playing field
for professionals with a first or working language other than English


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/open_source.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... and do all that leveraging the momentum and speed of
platforms that innovate rapidly and openly.

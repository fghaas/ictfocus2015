# Viaduct
Fixing what's Broken in Professional Technology Education


What's the
# biggest
challenge in
## technology
today?
Note: What, would you say, is the universal biggest challenge that
enterprises face when it comes to technology?


# Cost
Note: Is it the necessity to keep cost down and margins high?


# Scale
Note: Or the ability to quickly adapt to massive growth in demand, or
in customer base, for your products and services?


# Speed
Note: Or the ability to ramp up, innovate, and go to market quickly?


## Cost
## Scale
## Speed
## Nope <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: In fact, it's none of these.


Expected
## benefits
of modern data center technology
<div id="chart-benefits"></div>
Note: Because while reduced cost, improved scalability and quick
time-to-market are key to the expected **benefits** of modern
technology, like cloud, like distributed storage, like software
defined networking...


# #1
## challenge
in technology adoption:
Note: ... the universal #1 **challenge** that enterprises are facing ...


# Skill
Note: ... is one of skill. More precisely, hiring and training people
so that they are, and remain, able to know, understand and maintain
increasingly complex systems. So, why don't we train them?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/class-377117_1920.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->
Note: because this is what training in the technology industry looks
like. Face to face, single instructor. Small group. This is the best
and most effective way of transferring technology knowledge
today.

## Cost
## Scale
## Speed
## Nope <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: Is this a cost-effective model, that scales to any team size?
Does it allow teams to accumulate knowledge quickly, and does it
enable companies to innovate fast? It does neither.


Increasingly
### distributed
and complex systems have
## no match
in training
Note: In addition, while technology is getting increasingly complex
and distributed, training still happens in unrealistic, overly
simplified lab environments.


It's like sending people to
# Space
straight from the lecture hall.
Note: It's almost like putting astronauts in a lecture hall with a few
tabletop exercises, and then strapping them into a rocket and flying
them to space without ever setting foot in a realistic simulator.


This model is
# broken
and we're here to
# fix it.


# Viaduct
Bridging Canyons in Professional Education
Note: Viaduct is here to bridge the canyon between technology on the
one hand, and the skills required to run, operate and scale it on the
other, to enable enterprises to scale better and innovate faster.


## A&nbsp;platform
to bring


## cheap
## scalable
## rapid


## learning capability
to any organization.
Note: Why can we do this right now?


We have a
# unique
opportunity


to build
## a&nbsp;system
that is


# on-demand


# practical


# realistic


# immersive
Note: ... to create a whole new learning experience.


# Why
do we need this?


Legacy On-Demand Learning Systems are
## video-based


Legacy On-Demand Learning Systems are
## non-interactive


Legacy On-Demand Learning Systems are
## monolingual


Legacy On-Demand Learning Systems
## innovate slowly


# Viaduct
combines


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="//open.edx.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/logo-edx-openedx.png" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: the Open edX learning management platform, one which is sweeping
universities and academic institutions for its superior management
capabilities and flexibility, and it needs to come to professional
education.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openstack-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: OpenStack, a cloud management and orchestration platform
reshaping the way organizations manage and run their data centers.


Full
## Integration
With Real-Life Environments
Note: As a result, Viaduct provides a learning experience that is
directly and smoothly integrated with life-sized, complex
environments. This frees organizations from having to either maintain
a costly parallel training infrastructure, or to settle for
unrealistic scaled-down versions of complex environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/docker-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Imagine being able to give *each and every person* on your
virtualization team a massively scaleable container infrastructure,
using potentially hundreds of Docker containers.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/ceph-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every new hire on your storage team a whole distributed Ceph cluster to
play with in training.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Hadoop_logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every one of your Big Data developers a full Hadoop cluster.

And then combine this with...

Full
## Multi-Device
Capability
Note: ... a streamlined multi-device
learning platform, so anyone can learn from anywhere, using
desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices


Full
## Multi-Language
Capability
Note: ... and full multilanguage capability, to level the playing field
for professionals with a first or working language other than English


Fully
## Open Innovation
Note: ... and do all that leveraging the momentum and speed of
platforms that innovate rapidly and openly.

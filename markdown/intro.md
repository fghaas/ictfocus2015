What's the
# biggest
challenge in
## technology
today?


# Cost
Note: Is it the necessity to keep cost down and margins high?


# Scale
Note: Or the ability to quickly adapt to massive growth in demand, or
in customer base, for your products and services?


# Speed
Note: Or the ability to ramp up, innovate, and go to market quickly?

Note: Because while reduced cost, improved scalability and quick
time-to-market are key to the expected **benefits** of modern
technology, like cloud, like distributed storage, like software

in technology adoption:
Note: ... the universal #1 **challenge** that enterprises are facing ...


# Skill
Note: ... is one of skill. More precisely, hiring and training people
so that they are, and remain, able to know, understand and maintain
increasingly complex systems. So, why don't we train them?

Note: because this is what training in the IT industry looks
like. Face to face, single instructor. Small group. This is the best
and most effective way of transferring technology knowledge
today.

## Nope <!-- .element class="stamp fragment" -->
Note: Is this a cost-effective model that scales to any team size?
Does is allow teams to accumulate knowledge quickly? No it does
not. It doesn't help us to keep cost down, scale efficiently, or
innovate faster. This model has to go, and we want to replace it with
something better.

Bridging Canyons in Professional Education
Note: Viaduct is here to change this model, and replace it to bridge
the canyon between technology, and the skills required to run, operate
and scale it, with a new approach.
